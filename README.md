# Yazan - SQL-To-CI-Builder
SQL to Codeigniter Query Builder, A Converter written in PHP

### Features
- Converts SQL Queries to Codeigniter Query Builder. 
- Assists on creating optimal query as instructed in Codeigniter Documentation.  
- Provides options to interact with, for generating different results. 

### Supports 
- Codeigniter 3 
- Codeigniter 4 

### Demo

##### Online demo
Live demo and free usage is available <a href='http://152.70.176.144/sql-to-ci-builder/'>here</a>.

### Get Started
##### Install by a manual download: 
Download the repository and install required packages by composer.json.

##### Packagist
You can also install it from packagist by running the following command:
```html
composer require rexshijaku/sql-to-ci-builder
```

### Usage
##### Simple example

```php
<?php

use RexShijaku\SQLToCIBuilder\SQLToCIBuilder;

require_once dirname(__FILE__) . './vendor/autoload.php';

$options = array('civ' => 4);
$converter = new SQLToCIBuilder($options);

$sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM members";
echo $converter->convert($sql);
```
This will produce the following result: 
```php
$this->db->countAll('members');
```
##### A more complex example :

```php
$sql = "SELECT * FROM members WHERE age > 30 
                            OR (name LIKE 'J%' OR (surname='P' AND name IS NOT NULL)) AND AGE !=30";
$converter->convert($sql);
```
and this will generate the result below :
```php
$db->table('members')
 ->where('age >',30)
 ->orGroupStart()
     ->like('name','J','after')
     ->orGroupStart()
         ->where('surname','P')
         ->where('name !=',null)
     ->groupEnd()
 ->groupEnd()
 ->where('AGE !=',30)
 ->get();
```
##### Notice 
In both of these examples Codeigniter 4 was used. If you need to change it, or get more comprehensive understanding of provided options then see the following section of Options.
There are dozens of examples for every use case explained in the Query Builder documentation for both version 3 and version 4 located in their respecitve folders inside the <a href="https://github.com/rexshijaku/sql-to-ci-builder/tree/main/examples">examples</a> folder.

### Options
Some important options are briefly explained below:
| Argument  | DataType    | Default  | Description |
| ----- |:----------:| -----:| -----:|
| civ  | integer | 3 |  Your Codeigniter version. |
| db_instance  |  string | $this->db | Object in which database was loaded and initialized. |
| use_from |   boolean  | false  | In CodeIgniter 3, wether it should use 'from' command instead of 'get' to select data from a table. |
| group |   boolean | true  | Whether it should group key value pairs into a php array, or generate commands for each key value pair. |
| single_line |  boolean  | true |  When this argument is true, then converter tries to generate a single command instead of multiple. |

### How does it works ?
SQL-To-CI-Builder is built on top of <a href="hhttps://github.com/greenlion/PHP-SQL-Parser">PHP-SQL-Parser</a>. While <a href="hhttps://github.com/greenlion/PHP-SQL-Parser">PHP-SQL-Parser</a> is responsible for parsing the given SQL Query as input. The result of the  <a href="hhttps://github.com/greenlion/PHP-SQL-Parser">PHP-SQL-Parser</a> is the input of SQL-To-CI-Builder.

The structure has three main parts : 
1) Extractors classes - which help to pull out SQL Query parts in a way which are more understandable and processable by Builders. 
2) Builder classes - which help to construct Query Builder methods.
3) Creator - which orchestrates the process between Extractors and Builders in order to produce parts of Query Builder.

### Known issues
- It is not tested in all cases. They should be added.
- Poor error handling.
